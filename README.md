# Cats Vs Burgerz: Deluxe Edition 1.1

This is my game: pretty no-frills on the graphics side, but it has some handy features such as a pause button (toggles with spacebar), progressively faster enemies, and the occasional drop-down shield to let you survive cat-impacts. You can have up to 3 levels of armour, and your character glows brighter the more you have.

If I'd had more time, I would have added more powerups to give abilities like slowing down time, and stealth, which would reduce the player's opacity and bestow temporary invulnerability. I made the player character semi-transparent at one point just as a test and it looked hella cool - stealth burgers!

While making this program I learned a lot about how parent/child classes interact, although this lesson was only partially implemented with the Player/Enemy/Entity classes, and was more fully used in the text/Introtext classes, whose impact was less interesting visually but was a giant leap forward for my understanding of inheritance.

Also learned a surprising amount about interpreting the error and exception messages in the terminal, and how to navigate to the source of an error to fix it. Bug-hunting 101 achieved!
